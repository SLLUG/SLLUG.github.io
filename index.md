# Welcome to the Sarnia-Lambton Linux Users Group - SLLUG

* [Meetings](#meetings)
* [Advocacy](#advocacy)
* [Friends and Family](#friends)
* [Members](/members.html)
* [Contact](#contact)

This group is dedicated to the proliferation and advocacy of open source
software in the Sarnia-Lambton area. We meet monthly to discuss and learn
about Linux and other Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS).

The GNU/Linux system is an alternative operating system for multiple hardware
platforms that has been licensed under a series of permissive open source
software licenses. These licenses allow users to collaborate together openly to
build a better system.

To learn more, check out:

* [Linux.com's "What is Linux?"](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux)
* [Richard Stallman's "Linux and the GNU System"](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html)

### Donations

Several members have asked, "How can I help out?"

We accept donations of time, money, and equipment. If you would like to share funds
please add funds to our [PayPal Pool](https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/81FegeEP1w) or
arrange other donation methods with [Len Payne (len.payne@sllug.ca)](mailto:len.payne@sllug.ca).

## <a name="meetings" />Meetings

Ongoing meetings will be held on the Third Monday of the month (eg- Aug 20th, 2018).

Since the start of 2018, we hold monthly topical events, with a mix of discussion
on a specific FLOSS topic, and a mix of non-specific networking and camaraderie.

Meetings are free to attend for all time, for all participants. Interested
participants of all skill levels are encouraged to attend. We ask that
attendees under the age of 13 bring along an interested adult.

This is a reminder that our discussions are fairly free-formed, and if you, as a
member, would like to lead a discussion or show off a cool new technology, we
would love to see it.

If you'd like to reach us to learn more about Linux or Open Source tech, reach
out to the [Sarnia Tech Community](https://www.sarniatech.ca) where we have a #sllug
channel on the Slack chatroom.

#### <a name="2019-03-09" />March 9th, 2019 - 2nd Annual InstallFest

![InstallFest Info Image](/installfest-2019-03-09-fbevent.png)

Join us Saturday March 9th, 2019 for the Sarnia-Lambton Linux Users Group InstallFest.
You donâ€™t need to be a computer guru or even a power user. We will introduce you to
Open Source technologies and teach you how to harness them.

There will be activities for all levels of user, from the day-to-day web browser to the grey beard.

Food and drinks will be provided throughout the day. Seating is limited.

Schedule

- 10:30 - Introduction
- 11:00 - Team Formation
- 11:15 - Team Orientation
- 11:30 - Get Started
- 12:30 - Lunch
- 15:00 - Check-In
- 17:00 - Tear Down & Take Off

##### Beginner:

An opportunity to explore a variety of operating systems. Maybe you've thought of running Linux on your desktop, or you want to build a home theatre PC but would like some guidance.

##### Intermediate:

Already have some system skills? Come out and learn how to build web servers, database servers and other important systems that can be consumed by Track 1 and make the internet go

##### Advanced:

Be a part of the team that creates the virtual private cloud and container system that the Intermediates use to setup services.

We will be providing desktops, servers and software for all of this to work as well as a few key people who've done this sort of thing before to help guide everyone.

On Monday, January 21st at 7:00pm, you are invited to meet at Lambton College

Looking forward to seeing you all there!
