# Welcome to the Sarnia-Lambton Linux Users Group - SLLUG

* [Meetings](#meetings)
* [Communication](#communication)
* [Advocacy](#advocacy)
* [Friends and Family](#friends)
* [Members](/members.html)
* [Contact](#contact)

This group is dedicated to the proliferation and advocacy of open source
software in the Sarnia-Lambton area. We meet monthly to discuss and learn
about Linux and other Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS).

The GNU/Linux system is an alternative operating system for multiple hardware
platforms that has been licensed under a series of permissive open source
software licenses. These licenses allow users to collaborate together openly to
build a better system.

To learn more, check out:

* [Linux.com's "What is Linux?"](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux)
* [Richard Stallman's "Linux and the GNU System"](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html)

## <a name="meetings" />Meetings

Ongoing meetings will be held on the Third Monday of the month (eg- Nov 20th, 2017).

Starting in 2018, we plan to hold monthly topical events, with a mix of discussion
on a specific FLOSS topic, and a mix of non-specific networking and camaraderie.

Meetings are free to attend for all time, for all participants. Interested
participants of all skill levels are encouraged to attend. We ask that
attendees under the age of 13 bring along an interested adult.

### Upcoming Meetings

#### Feb 12th, 2018 - Year of the GNU/Linux Desktop

*NOTE: Date Change* - This event will NOT be on the third-Monday due to a conflict
with Ontario's Family Day.

We will have a guided presentation on February 12th, at 6:00pm to discuss the
available options for using FLOSS in a desktop environment.

The event will be held at theStory's Second Entrance:

    theStory's Second Entrance
    181 Christina Street N, Sarnia, ON N7T 5T8

![Enter north door of theStory](/theStory-SecondEntrance.jpg)

Please do NOT enter through the main entrance at theStory. Another group has a
fantastic event running from 4-7pm that we do not want to disturb. Use the next
door to the north: 181 Christina N (not 179).

This month's event will include short discussions on:

- Alternative Applications (ie- if not MS Office, then what?)
- Desktop Environments and Associated Tools
- Package Management and Update Systems
- Base Distributions and Forks
- How to Decide on YOUR GNU/Linux Pathway

#### Mar 19th, 2018 - Enterprise Server Needs

On the third Monday of March, we will resume our regularly scheduled programming
with a discussion about enterprise server needs.

This will include topics like:

- BSD vs Linux (Flavors and Benefits)
- Hypervisor Options for Virtual Hosts
- Open Source Storage Systems

#### Mar 24th, 2018 - InstallFest #1

The goal of this event is to offer a chance for users to install Linux.

This event will be audience-driven, but possible activities will include:

- Installing Linux to a RaspberryPi and connecting sensors to the GPIO ports
- Installing a Linux Desktop Environment to a desktop computer for personal use
- Advanced Linux Installation (Gentoo/Arch/Debian Minimal) in a VM or to hardware

Experienced users will be available to guide small groups through individual
activities and to answer questions.

Location is TBD

After a brief introudction to the topic, the conversation was be guided by
these major guiding questions:

- How is FLOSS used as an end-user?
- How is FLOSS used as a developer?
- How is FLOSS used as a business consumer?

Unmoderated conversations followed, based on the desires of the group.

#### Dec 18th, 2017 - Holiday Celebration

We had an informal holiday celebration on Monday, Dec 18th, at
6:00pm at:

#### Nov 20th, 2017 - Schedule Planning and LUG Rules/Regulations

Our second meet-and-greet/organizational meeting was Monday, Nov 20th, at
6:00pm at:

    Stoke's Inland Bar and Grill
    1202 Lambton Mall Rd, Sarnia, ON N7S 5R6

Agenda:

- Network Updates and Introductions
- 2018 Monthly Topic Choices and Ordering (eg- Storage in March, Linux in April)
- LUG Rules and Regulations - What are other groups using? What should we do?
- Future Location Taskforce

The major goal of this meeting was to build long-term plans about how meetings
will take place in the future. Specifically, 3/4ths of the agenda consists of
"What are we going to talk about?", "Who gets to decide?", and "Where will we
do it?"

Three major references will be:

- [Rick Moen's "Recipe for a Successful Linux User Group](ftp://linuxmafia.com/kb/Linux_PR/newlug.html)
- [K. Clark and R. Moen's "Linux User Group HOWTO"](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/User-Group-HOWTO.html)
- ["Create your LUG" by lugslist.com](http://lugslist.com/howto.php)

We are currently following the wise advice at [lugslist.com](http://lugslist.com/):

"just go out with geek friends for some beer/coffee/whatever somewhere and
launch a website to tell other people to join. If it is still active after some
months, write us so that we could include your organization in the list."

Feel free to join us!
