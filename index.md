# Welcome to the Sarnia-Lambton Linux Users Group - SLLUG

* [Meetings](#meetings)
* [Advocacy](#advocacy)
* [Friends and Family](#friends)
* [Members](/members.html)
* [Contact](#contact)

This group is dedicated to the proliferation and advocacy of open source
software in the Sarnia-Lambton area. We meet monthly to discuss and learn
about Linux and other Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS).

The GNU/Linux system is an alternative operating system for multiple hardware
platforms that has been licensed under a series of permissive open source
software licenses. These licenses allow users to collaborate together openly to
build a better system.

To learn more, check out:

* [Linux.com's "What is Linux?"](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux)
* [Richard Stallman's "Linux and the GNU System"](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html)

### Donations

Several members have asked, "How can I help out?"

We accept donations of time, money, and equipment. If you would like to share funds
please make arrangements with [Len Payne (len.payne@sllug.ca)](mailto:len.payne@sllug.ca).

## <a name="meetings" />Meetings

Ongoing meetings will be held on the Third Monday of the month (eg- Aug 20th, 2018).

Since the start of 2018, we hold monthly topical events, with a mix of discussion
on a specific FLOSS topic, and a mix of non-specific networking and camaraderie.

Meetings are free to attend for all time, for all participants. Interested
participants of all skill levels are encouraged to attend. We ask that
attendees under the age of 13 bring along an interested adult.

### COVID-19 Considerations

During the exceptional times of the pandemic, our in-person meetings have come to
a complete stand-still. However, our group has had sporadic luck meeting up still
on video chats. Our platform of choice is [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/), which is
an open source, hosted solution.

We use the [Sarnia Tech Community](https://sarniatech.ca)'s Slack instance to
communicate outside of those video chats, and have had a few interesting conversations.

We will keep you all updated as we rejoin the re-opening, but to be honest it may
still be many months away.

## <a name="advocacy" />Advocacy

Quarterly, we will have "InstallFest" events. At these events, experienced
users will guide newcomers through the installation process on a BYOD (bring
your own device) basis, or using donated hardware as available. Installation
options may include: Windows 10 `bash`, virtual machines, dual-boot, cloud
server installs, open source hardware installs (ie- Raspberry Pi) and others.

Other advocacy events will be scheduled sporadically throughout the year,
including but not limited to:

* Hackathons
* Open Source Debates
* Guest Speakers
* Conferences and Conventions
