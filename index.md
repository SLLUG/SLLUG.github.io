# Welcome to the Sarnia-Lambton Linux Users Group - SLLUG

* [Meetings](#meetings)
* [Advocacy](#advocacy)
* [Friends and Family](#friends)
* [Members](/members)
* [Contact](#contact)

This group is dedicated to the proliferation and advocacy of open source
software in the Sarnia-Lambton area. We meet monthly to discuss and learn
about Linux and other Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS).

The GNU/Linux system is an alternative operating system for multiple hardware
platforms that has been licensed under a series of permissive open source
software licenses. These licenses allow users to collaborate together openly to
build a better system.

To learn more, check out:

* [Linux.com's "What is Linux?"](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux)
* [Richard Stallman's "Linux and the GNU System"](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html)

## <a name="meetings" />Meetings

Ongoing meetings will be held on the Third Monday of the month (eg- Nov 20th, 2017).

Starting in 2018, we plan to hold monthly topical events, with a mix of discussion
on a specific FLOSS topic, and a mix of non-specific networking and camaraderie.

Meetings are free to attend for all time, for all participants. Interested
participants of all skill levels are encouraged to attend. We ask that
attendees under the age of 13 bring along an interested adult.

### Upcoming Meetings

#### Nov 20th, 2017 - Schedule Planning and LUG Rules/Regulations

Our second meet-and-greet/organizational meeting will be Monday, Nov 20th, at
6:00pm at:

    Stoke's Inland Bar and Grill
    1202 Lambton Mall Rd, Sarnia, ON N7S 5R6

Agenda:

- Network Updates and Introductions
- 2018 Monthly Topic Choices and Ordering (eg- Storage in March, Linux in April)
- LUG Rules and Regulations - What are other groups using? What should we do?
- Future Location Taskforce

The major goal of this meeting is to build long-term plans about how meetings
will take place in the future. Specifically, 3/4ths of the agenda consists of
"What are we going to talk about?", "Who gets to decide?", and "Where will we
do it?"

Three major references will be:

- ftp://linuxmafia.com/kb/Linux_PR/newlug.html
- http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/User-Group-HOWTO.html
- http://lugslist.com/howto.php

We are currently following the wise advice at lugslist.com:

"just go out with geek friends for some beer/coffee/whatever somewhere and
launch a website to tell other people to join. If it is still active after some
months, write us so that we could include your organization in the list."

Feel free to join us!

#### Dec 18th, 2017 - Holiday Celebration

Rough Agenda:

- Eat
- Drink

Quarterly, we will have "InstallFest" events. At these events, experienced
users will guide newcomers through the installation process on a BYOD (bring
your own device) basis, or using donated hardware as available. Installation
options may include: Windows 10 `bash`, virtual machines, dual-boot, cloud
server installs, open source hardware installs (ie- Raspberry Pi) and others.

Other advocacy events will be scheduled sporadically throughout the year,
including but not limited to:
