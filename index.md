# Welcome to the Sarnia-Lambton Linux Users Group - SLLUG

* [Meetings](#meetings)
* [Advocacy](#advocacy)
* [Friends and Family](#friends)

This group is dedicated to the proliferation and advocacy of open source
software in the Sarnia-Lambton area. We meet monthly to discuss and learn
about Linux and other Free and Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS).

## <a name="meetings" />Meetings

Meeting day/time is not yet determined. We aim to meet once each month to
address news, interesting techniques, and to discuss ongoing projects.

Meetings are free to attend for all time, for all participants. Interested
participants of all skill levels are encouraged to attend. We ask that
attendees under the age of 13 bring along an interested adult.

Quarterly, we will have "InstallFest" events. At these events, experienced
users will guide newcomers through the installation process on a BYOD (bring
your own device) basis, or using donated hardware as available. Installation
options may include: Windows 10 `bash`, virtual machines, dual-boot, cloud
server installs, open source hardware installs (ie- Raspberry Pi) and others.

Other advocacy events will be scheduled sporadically throughout the year,
including but not limited to:

* Hackathons
* Open Source Debates
* Guest Speakers
* Conferences and Conventions
