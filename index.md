# Welcome to the Sarnia-Lambton Linux Users Group - SLLUG

This group is dedicated to the proliferation and advocacy of open source
software in the Sarnia-Lambton area. We meet monthly to discuss and learn
about Linux and other Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS).

The GNU/Linux system is an alternative operating system for multiple hardware
platforms that has been licensed under a series of permissive open source
software licenses. These licenses allow users to collaborate together openly to
build a better system.

participants of all skill levels are encouraged to attend. We ask that
attendees under the age of 13 bring along an interested adult.

Quarterly, we will have "InstallFest" events. At these events, experienced
users will guide newcomers through the installation process on a BYOD (bring
your own device) basis, or using donated hardware as available. Installation
options may include: Windows 10 `bash`, virtual machines, dual-boot, cloud
server installs, open source hardware installs (ie- Raspberry Pi) and others.

Other advocacy events will be scheduled sporadically throughout the year,
including but not limited to:

* Hackathons
* Open Source Debates
* Guest Speakers
* Conferences and Conventions
