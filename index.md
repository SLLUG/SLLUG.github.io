# Welcome to the Sarnia-Lambton Linux Users Group - SLLUG

* [Meetings](#meetings)
* [InstallFest](#installfest)
* [Advocacy](#advocacy)
* [Friends and Family](#friends)
* [Members](/members.html)
* [Contact](#contact)

This group is dedicated to the proliferation and advocacy of open source
software in the Sarnia-Lambton area. We meet monthly to discuss and learn
about Linux and other Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS).

The GNU/Linux system is an alternative operating system for multiple hardware
platforms that has been licensed under a series of permissive open source
software licenses. These licenses allow users to collaborate together openly to
build a better system.

To learn more, check out:

* [Linux.com's "What is Linux?"](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux)
* [Richard Stallman's "Linux and the GNU System"](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html)

### Donations

Several members have asked, "How can I help out?"

We accept donations of time, money, and equipment. If you would like to share funds
please make arrangements with [Len Payne (len.payne@sllug.ca)](mailto:len.payne@sllug.ca).

## <a name="meetings" />Meetings

Ongoing meetings will be held on the Third Monday of the month (eg- Aug 20th, 2018).

Since re-opening post-pandemic, SLLUG has been meeting at 7:30pm on the Third Monday
at Two Amigos in Sarnia at 914 Murphy Road.

Since the start of 2018, we hold monthly topical events, with a mix of discussion
on a specific FLOSS topic, and a mix of non-specific networking and camaraderie.

Meetings are free to attend for all time, for all participants. Interested
participants of all skill levels are encouraged to attend. We ask that
attendees under the age of 13 bring along an interested adult.

We use the [Sarnia Tech Community](https://sarniatech.ca)'s Slack instance to
communicate outside of meetings, and have had a few interesting conversations.

### <a name="installfest" />March 18th, 2023 - InstallFest

![InstallFest Info Image](/installfest-2023-03-18.png)

The goal of this event is to offer a chance for users to work with free (as in 
freedom) open source software. This software is used every day, in devices all 
around you. The site you're viewing this through is built on free and open 
source software like Linux.

Come learn more about it!

This event will be audience-driven, but possible activities will include:

- Installing Linux to a RaspberryPi and connecting sensors to the GPIO ports
- Installing a Linux Desktop Environment to a desktop computer for personal use
- Advanced Linux Installation (Gentoo/Arch/Debian Minimal) in a VM or to hardware

Experienced users will be available to guide small groups through individual 
activities and to answer questions.

The event will be from 10-5 on Saturday, March 18th, in room D1-204 in the new 
building at Lambton College.

You can expect fun, food, and freedom. All for the low-low price of free so 
that you can learn more about free software (as in liberty.)

Activities will be available for Installers of all skill levels, from:

- Beginner (“I’ve never heard of this, please tell me more”), to
- Intermediate (“I’ve been meaning to install Gentoo one of these days”), to
- Advanced (“Let’s build a small business server including e-mail, web server, and logins”)

You can bring your own device and install Linux on that, or use one of our 
loaners kindly donated by the School of Computer Studies at Lambton College.

## <a name="advocacy" />Advocacy

Quarterly, we will have "InstallFest" events. At these events, experienced
users will guide newcomers through the installation process on a BYOD (bring
your own device) basis, or using donated hardware as available. Installation
options may include: Windows 10 `bash`, virtual machines, dual-boot, cloud
server installs, open source hardware installs (ie- Raspberry Pi) and others.

Other advocacy events will be scheduled sporadically throughout the year,
including but not limited to:

* Hackathons
