# Welcome to the Sarnia-Lambton Linux Users Group - SLLUG

* [Meetings](#meetings)
* [Communication](#communication)
* [Advocacy](#advocacy)
* [Friends and Family](#friends)
* [Members](/members.html)
* [Contact](#contact)

This group is dedicated to the proliferation and advocacy of open source
software in the Sarnia-Lambton area. We meet monthly to discuss and learn
about Linux and other Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS).

The GNU/Linux system is an alternative operating system for multiple hardware
platforms that has been licensed under a series of permissive open source
software licenses. These licenses allow users to collaborate together openly to
build a better system.

* [Linux.com's "What is Linux?"](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux)
* [Richard Stallman's "Linux and the GNU System"](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html)

### Donations

Several members have asked, "How can I help out?"

We accept donations of time, money, and equipment. If you would like to share funds
please add funds to our [PayPal Pool](https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/81FegeEP1w) or
arrange other donation methods with [Mark Dillon (mark.dillon@sllug.ca)](mailto:mark.dillon@sllug.ca).

## <a name="meetings" />Meetings

Ongoing meetings will be held on the Third Monday of the month (eg- Nov 20th, 2017).

Starting in 2018, we plan to hold monthly topical events, with a mix of discussion
on a specific FLOSS topic, and a mix of non-specific networking and camaraderie.

Meetings are free to attend for all time, for all participants. Interested
participants of all skill levels are encouraged to attend. We ask that
attendees under the age of 13 bring along an interested adult.

### Upcoming Meetings

#### <a name="2018-03-24" />Mar 24th, 2018 - InstallFest #1

The goal of this event is to offer a chance for users to install Linux.

This event will be audience-driven, but possible activities will include:

- Installing Linux to a RaspberryPi and connecting sensors to the GPIO ports
- Installing a Linux Desktop Environment to a desktop computer for personal use
- Advanced Linux Installation (Gentoo/Arch/Debian Minimal) in a VM or to hardware

Experienced users will be available to guide small groups through individual
activities and to answer questions.

The event will be from 10-4 on Saturday, March 24th, in room A223 at Lambton College.

You can expect fun, food, and freedom. All for the low-low price of free (as in 
pizza) so that you can learn more about free software (as in liberty.)

Activities will be available for Installers of all skill levels, from:
- Beginner ("I've never heard of this, please tell me more"), to
- Intermediate ("I've been meaning to install Gentoo one of these days"), to
- Advanced ("Let's build a small business server including e-mail, web server, and logins")

You can bring your own device and install Linux on that, or use one of our 
loaners kindly donated by the Information Technology Professional program.

#### <a name="2018-04-16" />Apr 16th, 2018 - Open Source Network Security

On the third Monday of April, we will discuss open source networking and security.

The event will be held at 6:00pm on April 16th at theStory's Second Entrance:
    
    theStory's Second Entrance
    181 Christina Street N, Sarnia, ON N7T 5T8

![Enter north door of theStory](/theStory-SecondEntrance.jpg)

As with March's exercise, members are encouraged to prepare a small bit of
information about their experiences (both new and old) with open source
network security technologies.

Topics will include but not be limited to:

- Firewall Technologies (pf vs iptables vs ???)
- Network Intrusion and Detection Systems
- Network Penetration Testing Systems

Our events typically involve a couple of hours of technical conversation, with 
small group networking continuing after the formal schedule concludes. Come join in!

If you'd like to reach us to learn more about Linux or Open Source tech,
remember that you can [join our mailing lists](https://mail.sllug.ca), join
us on freenode IRC @ #sllug, or reach out to the [Sarnia Tech Community](https://www.sarniatech.ca) 
where we have a #sllug channel on the Slack chatroom.

### Past Meetings

#### <a name="2018-03-19" />Mar 19th, 2018 - Enterprise Server Needs

On the third Monday of March, we resumed our regularly scheduled programming
with a discussion about enterprise server needs.

The event was held at 6:00pm on March 19th at theStory's Second Entrance:

    theStory's Second Entrance
    181 Christina Street N, Sarnia, ON N7T 5T8

![Enter north door of theStory](/theStory-SecondEntrance.jpg)

This included topics like:

- BSD vs Linux (Flavors and Benefits)
- Hypervisor Options for Virtual Hosts
- Open Source Storage Systems

To prepare for the meeting, attendees were encouraged to find a piece of tech that 
would be used on a server: a piece of tech you want to learn more about. And learn 
more about it. This meeting will be something of a show-and-tell for those
interested in sharing.

#### <a name="2018-02-12" />Feb 12th, 2018 - Year of the GNU/Linux Desktop

*NOTE: Date Change* - This event was NOT on the third-Monday due to a conflict
with Ontario's Family Day.

We had guided presentations on February 12th, at 6:00pm to discuss the
available options for using FLOSS in a desktop environment.

The event was held at theStory's Second Entrance:

    theStory's Second Entrance
    181 Christina Street N, Sarnia, ON N7T 5T8

![Enter north door of theStory](/theStory-SecondEntrance.jpg)

Please do NOT enter through the main entrance at theStory. Another group has a
fantastic event running from 4-7pm that we do not want to disturb. Use the next
door to the north: 181 Christina N (not 179).

This month's event included short discussions on:

- Alternative Applications (ie- if not MS Office, then what?)
- Desktop Environments and Associated Tools
- Package Management and Update Systems
- Base Distributions and Forks
- How to Decide on YOUR GNU/Linux Pathway

#### <a name="2018-01-15" />Jan 15th, 2018 - FLOSS Round Table

We had a round-table discussion on high-level Free/Libre Open Source
Software (FLOSS) topics. The format of this discussion was very open.

This meeting happened Monday, Jan 15th, at 6:00pm at:

    Meeting Room L211
    Lambton College
    1457 London Rd, Sarnia, ON N7S 6K4

For detailed directions:

[![College Map to L211](/CollegeMapToL211-Thumb.png)](CollegeMapToL211.png)

After a brief introudction to the topic, the conversation was be guided by
these major guiding questions:

- How is FLOSS used as an end-user?
- How is FLOSS used as a developer?
- How is FLOSS used as a business consumer?

Unmoderated conversations followed, based on the desires of the group.

We had an informal holiday celebration on Monday, Dec 18th, at

#### <a name="2017-11-20" />Nov 20th, 2017 - Schedule Planning and LUG Rules/Regulations

Our second meet-and-greet/organizational meeting was Monday, Nov 20th, at
6:00pm at:

    Stoke's Inland Bar and Grill
    1202 Lambton Mall Rd, Sarnia, ON N7S 5R6

Agenda:

- Network Updates and Introductions
- 2018 Monthly Topic Choices and Ordering (eg- Storage in March, Linux in April)
- LUG Rules and Regulations - What are other groups using? What should we do?
- Future Location Taskforce

The major goal of this meeting was to build long-term plans about how meetings
will take place in the future. Specifically, 3/4ths of the agenda consists of
"What are we going to talk about?", "Who gets to decide?", and "Where will we
do it?"

Three major references will be:

- [Rick Moen's "Recipe for a Successful Linux User Group](ftp://linuxmafia.com/kb/Linux_PR/newlug.html)
- [K. Clark and R. Moen's "Linux User Group HOWTO"](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/User-Group-HOWTO.html)
- ["Create your LUG" by lugslist.com](http://lugslist.com/howto.php)

We are currently following the wise advice at [lugslist.com](http://lugslist.com/):

"just go out with geek friends for some beer/coffee/whatever somewhere and
launch a website to tell other people to join. If it is still active after some
months, write us so that we could include your organization in the list."

Feel free to join us!

#### <a name="2017-10-16" />Oct 16th, 2017 - Inaugural Meet-and-Greet
