# Welcome to the Sarnia-Lambton Linux Users Group - SLLUG

* [Meetings](#meetings)
* [Communication](#communication)
* [Advocacy](#advocacy)
* [Friends and Family](#friends)
* [Members](/members.html)
* [Contact](#contact)

This group is dedicated to the proliferation and advocacy of open source
software in the Sarnia-Lambton area. We meet monthly to discuss and learn
about Linux and other Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS).

The GNU/Linux system is an alternative operating system for multiple hardware
platforms that has been licensed under a series of permissive open source
software licenses. These licenses allow users to collaborate together openly to
build a better system.

To learn more, check out:

* [Linux.com's "What is Linux?"](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux)
* [Richard Stallman's "Linux and the GNU System"](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html)

### Donations

Several members have asked, "How can I help out?"

We accept donations of time, money, and equipment. If you would like to share funds
please add funds to our [PayPal Pool](https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/81FegeEP1w) or
arrange other donation methods with [Mark Dillon (mark.dillon@sllug.ca)](mailto:mark.dillon@sllug.ca).

## <a name="meetings" />Meetings

Ongoing meetings will be held on the Third Monday of the month (eg- Aug 20th, 2018).

Since the start of 2018, we hold monthly topical events, with a mix of discussion
on a specific FLOSS topic, and a mix of non-specific networking and camaraderie.

Meetings are free to attend for all time, for all participants. Interested
participants of all skill levels are encouraged to attend. We ask that
attendees under the age of 13 bring along an interested adult.

### Past Meetings

#### <a name="2019-01-21" />January 21st, 2019 - Community Outreach

On Monday, January 21st at 7:00pm, you are invited to meet at Lambton College
in meeting room A2-126 (this used to be room L211.) Parking is no longer
monitored after 6pm, so parking is free. The easiest access is at the south
end of the parking lot, into the newly renovated Centre of Excellence. Go up
to the second floor, and the meeting room is wrapped around the corner.

If you're unsure where to go, please reach out to Len or another member of
the group, or [refer to the campus maps](https://www.lambtoncollege.ca/Contact/Maps_and_Directions/Campus_Maps/).

The goal of this meeting is to collaborate on an outreach strategy, including
but not limited to:

- An Open Source Starter Pack
- List of Community Partners
- Scheduling and Planning our 2019 InstallFest

Looking forward to seeing you all there!
