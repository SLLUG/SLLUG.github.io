# Welcome to the Sarnia-Lambton Linux Users Group - SLLUG

* [Meetings](#meetings)
* [Communication](#communication)
* [Advocacy](#advocacy)
* [Friends and Family](#friends)
* [Members](/members.html)
* [Contact](#contact)

This group is dedicated to the proliferation and advocacy of open source
software in the Sarnia-Lambton area. We meet monthly to discuss and learn
about Linux and other Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS).

The GNU/Linux system is an alternative operating system for multiple hardware
platforms that has been licensed under a series of permissive open source
software licenses. These licenses allow users to collaborate together openly to
build a better system.

* [Richard Stallman's "Linux and the GNU System"](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html)

### Donations

Several members have asked, "How can I help out?"

We accept donations of time, money, and equipment. If you would like to share funds
please add funds to our [PayPal Pool](https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/81FegeEP1w) or
arrange other donation methods with [Mark Dillon (mark.dillon@sllug.ca)](mailto:mark.dillon@sllug.ca).

## <a name="meetings" />Meetings

Ongoing meetings will be held on the Third Monday of the month (eg- Aug 20th, 2018).

Since the start of 2018, we hold monthly topical events, with a mix of discussion
on a specific FLOSS topic, and a mix of non-specific networking and camaraderie.

Meetings are free to attend for all time, for all participants. Interested
participants of all skill levels are encouraged to attend. We ask that
attendees under the age of 13 bring along an interested adult.

### Past Meetings

#### <a name="2018-07-16" />July 16th, 2018 - ???!

We met. There were about six of us. We talked about a lot of things, and some of
them were even Linux-related. Thanks for those that showed up on short notice.

#### <a name="2018-06-18" />June 18th, 2018 - Demo Night

Due to some confusion around the holiday, our plans for May's meeting were cut
short. So June's meeting is going to be a bit of a combination of demonstrations.

On the third Monday of June, SLLUG members Mark Dillon and Paul Belanger have
two very different demos to share with the group. Both are based on FLOSS and
are topics near and dear to the hearts of both of our presenters.

The event will held at 6:00pm on June 18th at [theStory](https://www.thestory.ca/):

    theStory - Sacred Space and Community Venue
    179 Christina Street N, Sarnia, ON N7T 5T8

This is a reminder that our discussions are fairly free-formed, and if you, as a
member, would like to lead a discussion or show off a cool new technology, we
would love to see it.

At this event, Mark will be presenting his Demoscene example. Demoscene is a
longstanding computer art tradition that was traditionally packaged with... the
OTHER kind of free software. The goal of Demoscene is to produce a minimally
sized executable that runs a fancy graphics demonstration. In recent years, the
community has adopted a lot of open source into the mix, and is thriving in
slightly less dark corners of the internet these days.

For more information about what "Demoscene" is, check out [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene)
or [pouÃ«t.net](http://www.pouet.net/).

Also at this event, Paul will be presenting a Raspberry Pi orchestration example.
Paul is a strong proponent of Ansible, a systems configuration and management
suite. He will be using Ansible to demonstrate to us how to easily turn a small
stack of Raspberry Pi units into a portable management unit for an InstallFest.

For more information about Ansible, check out [the official website](https://www.ansible.com/)
and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_%28software%29).

Our events typically involve a couple of hours of technical conversation, with
small group networking continuing after the formal schedule concludes. Come join in!

    Stoke's Inland Bar and Grill
    1202 Lambton Mall Rd, Sarnia, ON N7S 5R6

options may include: Windows 10 `bash`, virtual machines, dual-boot, cloud
server installs, open source hardware installs (ie- Raspberry Pi) and others.

Other advocacy events will be scheduled sporadically throughout the year,
including but not limited to:

* Hackathons
