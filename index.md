# Welcome to the Sarnia-Lambton Linux Users Group - SLLUG

* [Meetings](#meetings)
* [Communication](#communication)
* [Advocacy](#advocacy)
* [Friends and Family](#friends)
* [Members](/members.html)
* [Contact](#contact)

This group is dedicated to the proliferation and advocacy of open source
software in the Sarnia-Lambton area. We meet monthly to discuss and learn
about Linux and other Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS).

The GNU/Linux system is an alternative operating system for multiple hardware
platforms that has been licensed under a series of permissive open source
software licenses. These licenses allow users to collaborate together openly to
build a better system.

* [Richard Stallman's "Linux and the GNU System"](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html)

### Donations

Several members have asked, "How can I help out?"

We accept donations of time, money, and equipment. If you would like to share funds
please add funds to our [PayPal Pool](https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/81FegeEP1w) or
arrange other donation methods with [Mark Dillon (mark.dillon@sllug.ca)](mailto:mark.dillon@sllug.ca).

## <a name="meetings" />Meetings

Ongoing meetings will be held on the Third Monday of the month (eg- Nov 20th, 2017).

Starting in 2018, we plan to hold monthly topical events, with a mix of discussion
on a specific FLOSS topic, and a mix of non-specific networking and camaraderie.

Meetings are free to attend for all time, for all participants. Interested
participants of all skill levels are encouraged to attend. We ask that
attendees under the age of 13 bring along an interested adult.

### Upcoming Meetings

#### <a name="2018-06-18" />June 18th, 2018 - Demo Night

Due to some confusion around the holiday, our plans for May's meeting were cut
short. So June's meeting is going to be a bit of a combination of demonstrations.

On the third Monday of June, SLLUG members Mark Dillon and Paul Belanger have
two very different demos to share with the group. Both are based on FLOSS and
are topics near and dear to the hearts of both of our presenters.

The event will held at 6:00pm on June 18th at [theStory](https://www.thestory.ca/):

    theStory - Sacred Space and Community Venue
    179 Christina Street N, Sarnia, ON N7T 5T8

This is a reminder that our discussions are fairly free-formed, and if you, as a
member, would like to lead a discussion or show off a cool new technology, we
would love to see it.

At this event, Mark will be presenting his Demoscene example. Demoscene is a
longstanding computer art tradition that was traditionally packaged with... the
OTHER kind of free software. The goal of Demoscene is to produce a minimally
sized executable that runs a fancy graphics demonstration. In recent years, the
community has adopted a lot of open source into the mix, and is thriving in
slightly less dark corners of the internet these days.

For more information about what "Demoscene" is, check out [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene)
or [pouÃ«t.net](http://www.pouet.net/).

Also at this event, Paul will be presenting a Raspberry Pi orchestration example.
Paul is a strong proponent of Ansible, a systems configuration and management
suite. He will be using Ansible to demonstrate to us how to easily turn a small
stack of Raspberry Pi units into a portable management unit for an InstallFest.

For more information about Ansible, check out [the official website](https://www.ansible.com/)
and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_%28software%29).

Our events typically involve a couple of hours of technical conversation, with
small group networking continuing after the formal schedule concludes. Come join in!

If you'd like to reach us to learn more about Linux or Open Source tech,
remember that you can [join our mailing lists](https://mail.sllug.ca), join
us on freenode IRC @ #sllug, or reach out to the [Sarnia Tech Community](https://www.sarniatech.ca)
where we have a #sllug channel on the Slack chatroom.

    theStory's Second Entrance
    181 Christina Street N, Sarnia, ON N7T 5T8

As with March's exercise, members were encouraged to prepare a small bit of
information about their experiences (both new and old) with open source
networking and security technologies.

Topics will include but not be limited to:

- Firewall Technologies (pf vs iptables vs ???)
- Network Intrusion and Detection Systems
- Network Penetration Testing Systems

#### <a name="2018-03-24" />Mar 24th, 2018 - InstallFest #1

[See the InstallFest #1 Page for More Details](/installfest-2018-03-24.html)

The goal of this event is to offer a chance for users to install Linux.

This event will be audience-driven, but possible activities will include:

- Installing Linux to a RaspberryPi and connecting sensors to the GPIO ports
- Installing a Linux Desktop Environment to a desktop computer for personal use
- Advanced Linux Installation (Gentoo/Arch/Debian Minimal) in a VM or to hardware

Experienced users will be available to guide small groups through individual
activities and to answer questions.

The event will be from 10-4 on Saturday, March 24th, in room A223 at Lambton College.

You can expect fun, food, and freedom. All for the low-low price of free (as in
pizza) so that you can learn more about free software (as in liberty.)

Activities will be available for Installers of all skill levels, from:
- Beginner ("I've never heard of this, please tell me more"), to
- Intermediate ("I've been meaning to install Gentoo one of these days"), to
- Advanced ("Let's build a small business server including e-mail, web server, and logins")

You can bring your own device and install Linux on that, or use one of our
loaners kindly donated by the Information Technology Professional program.
