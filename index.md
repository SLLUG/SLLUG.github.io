# Welcome to the Sarnia-Lambton Linux Users Group - SLLUG

* [Meetings](#meetings)
* [Communication](#communication)
* [Advocacy](#advocacy)
* [Friends and Family](#friends)
* [Members](/members.html)
* [Contact](#contact)

This group is dedicated to the proliferation and advocacy of open source
software in the Sarnia-Lambton area. We meet monthly to discuss and learn
about Linux and other Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS).

The GNU/Linux system is an alternative operating system for multiple hardware
platforms that has been licensed under a series of permissive open source
software licenses. These licenses allow users to collaborate together openly to
build a better system.

To learn more, check out:

* [Linux.com's "What is Linux?"](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux)
* [Richard Stallman's "Linux and the GNU System"](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html)

### Donations

Several members have asked, "How can I help out?"

We accept donations of time, money, and equipment. If you would like to share funds
please add funds to our [PayPal Pool](https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/81FegeEP1w) or
arrange other donation methods with [Mark Dillon (mark.dillon@sllug.ca)](mailto:mark.dillon@sllug.ca).

## <a name="meetings" />Meetings

Ongoing meetings will be held on the Third Monday of the month (eg- Aug 20th, 2018).

Since the start of 2018, we hold monthly topical events, with a mix of discussion
on a specific FLOSS topic, and a mix of non-specific networking and camaraderie.

Meetings are free to attend for all time, for all participants. Interested
participants of all skill levels are encouraged to attend. We ask that
attendees under the age of 13 bring along an interested adult.

#### <a name="2018-10-15" />October 15th, 2018 - Current Events in Kernel Development

On the third Monday of October, SLLUG members are invited to join us for a
discussion around the current state of affairs in Linux Kernel Development.

[Linus is taking a break to cool his head](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/09/17/linus_torvalds_linux_apology_break/),
and a new [Code of Conduct has been applied](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=8a104f8b5867c682d994ffa7a74093c54469c11f).
The new code includes bannable offenses, which has resulted in bans already.
Some developers [are not happy about it](http://archive.is/vJCtJ).

We're gonna talk about it!

The event will held at 7:00pm on October 15th at [Stoke's Inland](http://www.stokesinland.com/):

#### <a name="2018-09-17" />September 17th, 2018 - Why Linux?!

On the third Monday of September, SLLUG members are invited to come tell their
stories at the Story! Specifically, we want to know: why do you use Linux and
Open Source Software? What got you into it? What keeps you into it?

Feel free to bring audio/visual aids to tell your story, or just hold a 
"campfire chat" to share your experiences.

The event will held at 7:00pm on September 17th at [theStory](https://www.thestory.ca/):

discuss our future plans for a hackday. Topics of discussion will include:

#### <a name="2018-07-16" />July 16th, 2018 - ???!

We met. There were about six of us. We talked about a lot of things, and some of
them were even Linux-related. Thanks for those that showed up on short notice.

#### <a name="2018-06-18" />June 18th, 2018 - Demo Night

Due to some confusion around the holiday, our plans for May's meeting were cut
short. So June's meeting is going to be a bit of a combination of demonstrations.

On the third Monday of June, SLLUG members Mark Dillon and Paul Belanger have
two very different demos to share with the group. Both are based on FLOSS and
are topics near and dear to the hearts of both of our presenters.

The event will held at 6:00pm on June 18th at [theStory](https://www.thestory.ca/):

    theStory - Sacred Space and Community Venue
    179 Christina Street N, Sarnia, ON N7T 5T8

This is a reminder that our discussions are fairly free-formed, and if you, as a
member, would like to lead a discussion or show off a cool new technology, we
would love to see it.

At this event, Mark will be presenting his Demoscene example. Demoscene is a
longstanding computer art tradition that was traditionally packaged with... the
OTHER kind of free software. The goal of Demoscene is to produce a minimally
sized executable that runs a fancy graphics demonstration. In recent years, the
community has adopted a lot of open source into the mix, and is thriving in
slightly less dark corners of the internet these days.

For more information about what "Demoscene" is, check out [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene)
or [pouët.net](http://www.pouet.net/).

Also at this event, Paul will be presenting a Raspberry Pi orchestration example.
Paul is a strong proponent of Ansible, a systems configuration and management
suite. He will be using Ansible to demonstrate to us how to easily turn a small
stack of Raspberry Pi units into a portable management unit for an InstallFest.

For more information about Ansible, check out [the official website](https://www.ansible.com/)
and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_%28software%29).

Our events typically involve a couple of hours of technical conversation, with
small group networking continuing after the formal schedule concludes. Come join in!

#### <a name="2018-05-14" />May 14th, 2018 - Multimedia Production and Consumption

On the ~~third~~ second Monday of May, the group discussed open source tools for
multimedia production and consumption.

The event was held at 6:00pm on May 14th at theStory's Second Entrance:

#### <a name="2018-05-09" />May 9th, 2018 - Planning Meeting

At the April meeting, the group decided to meet up to plan out what we need to
do for future events.

The group met at Stokes Inland at 7:00pm on Wednesday May 9th.

    Stoke's Inland Bar and Grill
    1202 Lambton Mall Rd, Sarnia, ON N7S 5R6

Discussion focused around:
