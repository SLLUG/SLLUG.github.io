#### <a name="2017-11-20" />Nov 20th, 2017 - Schedule Planning and LUG Rules/Regulations

Our second meet-and-greet/organizational meeting was Monday, Nov 20th, at
6:00pm at:

    Stoke's Inland Bar and Grill
    1202 Lambton Mall Rd, Sarnia, ON N7S 5R6

Agenda:

- Network Updates and Introductions
- 2018 Monthly Topic Choices and Ordering (eg- Storage in March, Linux in April)
- LUG Rules and Regulations - What are other groups using? What should we do?
- Future Location Taskforce

The major goal of this meeting was to build long-term plans about how meetings
will take place in the future. Specifically, 3/4ths of the agenda consists of
"What are we going to talk about?", "Who gets to decide?", and "Where will we
do it?"

Three major references will be:

- [Rick Moen's "Recipe for a Successful Linux User Group](ftp://linuxmafia.com/kb/Linux_PR/newlug.html)
- [K. Clark and R. Moen's "Linux User Group HOWTO"](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/User-Group-HOWTO.html)
- ["Create your LUG" by lugslist.com](http://lugslist.com/howto.php)

We are currently following the wise advice at [lugslist.com](http://lugslist.com/):

"just go out with geek friends for some beer/coffee/whatever somewhere and
launch a website to tell other people to join. If it is still active after some
months, write us so that we could include your organization in the list."

Feel free to join us!
