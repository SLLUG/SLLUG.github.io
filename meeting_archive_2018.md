### Past Meeting from 2018

#### <a name="2018-04-16" />Apr 16th, 2018 - Open Source Network Security

On the third Monday of April, we discussed open source networking and security.

The event was held at 6:00pm on April 16th at theStory's Second Entrance:

    theStory's Second Entrance
    181 Christina Street N, Sarnia, ON N7T 5T8

As with March's exercise, members were encouraged to prepare a small bit of
information about their experiences (both new and old) with open source
networking and security technologies.

Topics will include but not be limited to:

- Firewall Technologies (pf vs iptables vs ???)
- Network Intrusion and Detection Systems
- Network Penetration Testing Systems

#### <a name="2018-03-24" />Mar 24th, 2018 - InstallFest #1

[See the InstallFest #1 Page for More Details](/installfest-2018-03-24.html)

The goal of this event is to offer a chance for users to install Linux.

This event will be audience-driven, but possible activities will include:

- Installing Linux to a RaspberryPi and connecting sensors to the GPIO ports
- Installing a Linux Desktop Environment to a desktop computer for personal use
- Advanced Linux Installation (Gentoo/Arch/Debian Minimal) in a VM or to hardware

Experienced users will be available to guide small groups through individual
activities and to answer questions.

The event will be from 10-4 on Saturday, March 24th, in room A223 at Lambton College.

You can expect fun, food, and freedom. All for the low-low price of free (as in
pizza) so that you can learn more about free software (as in liberty.)

Activities will be available for Installers of all skill levels, from:
- Beginner ("I've never heard of this, please tell me more"), to
- Intermediate ("I've been meaning to install Gentoo one of these days"), to
- Advanced ("Let's build a small business server including e-mail, web server, and logins")

You can bring your own device and install Linux on that, or use one of our
loaners kindly donated by the Information Technology Professional program.

#### <a name="2018-03-19" />Mar 19th, 2018 - Enterprise Server Needs

On the third Monday of March, we resumed our regularly scheduled programming
with a discussion about enterprise server needs.

The event was held at 6:00pm on March 19th at theStory's Second Entrance:

To prepare for the meeting, attendees were encouraged to find a piece of tech that
would be used on a server: a piece of tech you want to learn more about. And learn
more about it. This meeting will be something of a show-and-tell for those
interested in sharing.

#### <a name="2018-02-12" />Feb 12th, 2018 - Year of the GNU/Linux Desktop

*NOTE: Date Change* - This event was NOT on the third-Monday due to a conflict
with Ontario's Family Day.

available options for using FLOSS in a desktop environment.

The event was held at theStory's Second Entrance:

    theStory's Second Entrance

Please do NOT enter through the main entrance at theStory. Another group has a
fantastic event running from 4-7pm that we do not want to disturb. Use the next

This month's event included short discussions on:

Software (FLOSS) topics. The format of this discussion was very open.

After a brief introudction to the topic, the conversation was be guided by
these major guiding questions:

- How is FLOSS used as an end-user?
- How is FLOSS used as a developer?
- How is FLOSS used as a business consumer?

Unmoderated conversations followed, based on the desires of the group.
