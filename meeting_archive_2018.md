### Past Meeting from 2018

#### <a name="2018-03-19" />Mar 19th, 2018 - Enterprise Server Needs

On the third Monday of March, we resumed our regularly scheduled programming
with a discussion about enterprise server needs.

The event was held at 6:00pm on March 19th at theStory's Second Entrance:

    theStory's Second Entrance
    181 Christina Street N, Sarnia, ON N7T 5T8

This included topics like:

- BSD vs Linux (Flavors and Benefits)
- Hypervisor Options for Virtual Hosts
- Open Source Storage Systems

To prepare for the meeting, attendees were encouraged to find a piece of tech that
would be used on a server: a piece of tech you want to learn more about. And learn
more about it. This meeting will be something of a show-and-tell for those
interested in sharing.

#### <a name="2018-02-12" />Feb 12th, 2018 - Year of the GNU/Linux Desktop

*NOTE: Date Change* - This event was NOT on the third-Monday due to a conflict
with Ontario's Family Day.

We had guided presentations on February 12th, at 6:00pm to discuss the
available options for using FLOSS in a desktop environment.

The event was held at theStory's Second Entrance:

    theStory's Second Entrance
    181 Christina Street N, Sarnia, ON N7T 5T8

Please do NOT enter through the main entrance at theStory. Another group has a
fantastic event running from 4-7pm that we do not want to disturb. Use the next
door to the north: 181 Christina N (not 179).

This month's event included short discussions on:

- Alternative Applications (ie- if not MS Office, then what?)
- Desktop Environments and Associated Tools
- Package Management and Update Systems
- Base Distributions and Forks
- How to Decide on YOUR GNU/Linux Pathway

#### <a name="2018-01-15" />Jan 15th, 2018 - FLOSS Round Table

We had a round-table discussion on high-level Free/Libre Open Source
Software (FLOSS) topics. The format of this discussion was very open.

This meeting happened Monday, Jan 15th, at 6:00pm at:

    Meeting Room L211

    1457 London Rd, Sarnia, ON N7S 6K4

For detailed directions:

After a brief introudction to the topic, the conversation was be guided by
these major guiding questions:

- How is FLOSS used as an end-user?
- How is FLOSS used as a developer?
- How is FLOSS used as a business consumer?

Unmoderated conversations followed, based on the desires of the group.
