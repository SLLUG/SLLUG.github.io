We are heading to the new location of District Beta to bring an end to the 2018
season of the Sarnia Tech Community.

    Where:  1886 London Line, Sarnia, Ontario N7W 1B3
    Time:   6:00 - 10:00pm
    Date:   Wed, Dec 19th
    Treats: We will provide pizza, and will have a couple VR booths booked to
            share. There will also be retro gaming stations and casual
            conversations to keep a body busy.

Note for infrequent visitors, District Beta has relocated into a prime location
closer to the road in the same plaza, next to Hiway Bowl.

Food will be graciously covered by our sponsors at [Plexus Dev](http://www.plexusdev.com/)
and [Sarnia Inkspot](http://www.sarniainkspot.com/). All STC and SLLUG members in

free time in the VR booths at District Beta.

The new location for District Beta also includes a licensed bar, so if you're
planning on partaking, please plan to arrive and leave safely.

For more information about what District Beta has to offer, head over to their
website at [www.DistrictBeta.ca](https://www.districtbeta.ca)

So come on out and join us: shake some snow off your boots and warm your belly
with some like minded tech heads. We'll see you there!

#### <a name="2018-10-15" />October 15th, 2018 - Current Events in Kernel Development

On the third Monday of October, SLLUG members are invited to join us for a
discussion around the current state of affairs in Linux Kernel Development.

[Linus is taking a break to cool his head](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/09/17/linus_torvalds_linux_apology_break/),
and a new [Code of Conduct has been applied](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=8a104f8b5867c682d994ffa7a74093c54469c11f).
The new code includes bannable offenses, which has resulted in bans already.
Some developers [are not happy about it](http://archive.is/vJCtJ).

We're gonna talk about it!

The event will held at 7:00pm on October 15th at [Stoke's Inland](http://www.stokesinland.com/):

#### <a name="2018-09-17" />September 17th, 2018 - Why Linux?!

On the third Monday of September, SLLUG members are invited to come tell their
stories at the Story! Specifically, we want to know: why do you use Linux and
Open Source Software? What got you into it? What keeps you into it?

Feel free to bring audio/visual aids to tell your story, or just hold a
"campfire chat" to share your experiences.

The event will held at 7:00pm on September 17th at [theStory](https://www.thestory.ca/):

#### <a name="2018-07-16" />July 16th, 2018 - ???!

We met. There were about six of us. We talked about a lot of things, and some of
them were even Linux-related. Thanks for those that showed up on short notice.

#### <a name="2018-06-18" />June 18th, 2018 - Demo Night

Due to some confusion around the holiday, our plans for May's meeting were cut
short. So June's meeting is going to be a bit of a combination of demonstrations.

On the third Monday of June, SLLUG members Mark Dillon and Paul Belanger have
two very different demos to share with the group. Both are based on FLOSS and
are topics near and dear to the hearts of both of our presenters.

The event will held at 6:00pm on June 18th at [theStory](https://www.thestory.ca/):

    theStory - Sacred Space and Community Venue
    179 Christina Street N, Sarnia, ON N7T 5T8

This is a reminder that our discussions are fairly free-formed, and if you, as a
member, would like to lead a discussion or show off a cool new technology, we
would love to see it.

At this event, Mark will be presenting his Demoscene example. Demoscene is a
longstanding computer art tradition that was traditionally packaged with... the
OTHER kind of free software. The goal of Demoscene is to produce a minimally
sized executable that runs a fancy graphics demonstration. In recent years, the
community has adopted a lot of open source into the mix, and is thriving in
slightly less dark corners of the internet these days.

For more information about what "Demoscene" is, check out [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene)
or [pouÃ«t.net](http://www.pouet.net/).

Also at this event, Paul will be presenting a Raspberry Pi orchestration example.
Paul is a strong proponent of Ansible, a systems configuration and management
suite. He will be using Ansible to demonstrate to us how to easily turn a small
stack of Raspberry Pi units into a portable management unit for an InstallFest.

For more information about Ansible, check out [the official website](https://www.ansible.com/)
and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_%28software%29).

Our events typically involve a couple of hours of technical conversation, with
small group networking continuing after the formal schedule concludes. Come join in!

#### <a name="2018-03-24" />Mar 24th, 2018 - InstallFest #1

[See the InstallFest #1 Page for More Details](/installfest-2018-03-24.html)

The goal of this event is to offer a chance for users to install Linux.

This event will be audience-driven, but possible activities will include:

- Installing Linux to a RaspberryPi and connecting sensors to the GPIO ports
- Installing a Linux Desktop Environment to a desktop computer for personal use
- Advanced Linux Installation (Gentoo/Arch/Debian Minimal) in a VM or to hardware

Experienced users will be available to guide small groups through individual
activities and to answer questions.

The event will be from 10-4 on Saturday, March 24th, in room A223 at Lambton College.

You can expect fun, food, and freedom. All for the low-low price of free (as in
pizza) so that you can learn more about free software (as in liberty.)

Activities will be available for Installers of all skill levels, from:
- Beginner ("I've never heard of this, please tell me more"), to
- Intermediate ("I've been meaning to install Gentoo one of these days"), to
- Advanced ("Let's build a small business server including e-mail, web server, and logins")

You can bring your own device and install Linux on that, or use one of our
loaners kindly donated by the Information Technology Professional program.

To prepare for the meeting, attendees were encouraged to find a piece of tech that
would be used on a server: a piece of tech you want to learn more about. And learn
more about it. This meeting will be something of a show-and-tell for those
interested in sharing.

#### <a name="2018-02-12" />Feb 12th, 2018 - Year of the GNU/Linux Desktop

*NOTE: Date Change* - This event was NOT on the third-Monday due to a conflict

available options for using FLOSS in a desktop environment.

The event was held at theStory's Second Entrance:

    theStory's Second Entrance

Please do NOT enter through the main entrance at theStory. Another group has a
fantastic event running from 4-7pm that we do not want to disturb. Use the next

This month's event included short discussions on:

- Alternative Applications (ie- if not MS Office, then what?)
- Desktop Environments and Associated Tools

Software (FLOSS) topics. The format of this discussion was very open.

    Meeting Room L211
    Lambton College
    1457 London Rd, Sarnia, ON N7S 6K4

After a brief introudction to the topic, the conversation was be guided by
these major guiding questions:

- How is FLOSS used as an end-user?
- How is FLOSS used as a developer?
- How is FLOSS used as a business consumer?

Unmoderated conversations followed, based on the desires of the group.
