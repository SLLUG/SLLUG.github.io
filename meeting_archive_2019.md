This is a reminder that our discussions are fairly free-formed, and if you, as a
member, would like to lead a discussion or show off a cool new technology, we
would love to see it.

If you'd like to reach us to learn more about Linux or Open Source tech, reach
out to the [Sarnia Tech Community](https://www.sarniatech.ca) where we have a #sllug
channel on the Slack chatroom.

Join us Saturday March 9th, 2019 for the Sarnia-Lambton Linux Users Group InstallFest.
You donâ€™t need to be a computer guru or even a power user. We will introduce you to
Open Source technologies and teach you how to harness them.

There will be activities for all levels of user, from the day-to-day web browser to the grey beard.

Food and drinks will be provided throughout the day. Seating is limited.

##### Beginner:

An opportunity to explore a variety of operating systems. Maybe you've thought of running Linux on your desktop, or you want to build a home theatre PC but would like some guidance.

##### Intermediate:

Already have some system skills? Come out and learn how to build web servers, database servers and other important systems that can be consumed by Track 1 and make the internet go

##### Advanced:

Be a part of the team that creates the virtual private cloud and container system that the Intermediates use to setup services.

We will be providing desktops, servers and software for all of this to work as well as a few key people who've done this sort of thing before to help guide everyone.

#### <a name="2019-01-21" />January 21st, 2019 - Community Outreach

On Monday, January 21st at 7:00pm, you are invited to meet at Lambton College
in meeting room A2-126 (this used to be room L211.) Parking is no longer

end of the parking lot, into the newly renovated Centre of Excellence. Go up
to the second floor, and the meeting room is wrapped around the corner.

If you're unsure where to go, please reach out to Len or another member of
the group, or [refer to the campus maps](https://www.lambtoncollege.ca/Contact/Maps_and_Directions/Campus_Maps/).

The goal of this meeting is to collaborate on an outreach strategy, including
but not limited to:

- An Open Source Starter Pack
- List of Community Partners
- Scheduling and Planning our 2019 InstallFest

Looking forward to seeing you all there!
